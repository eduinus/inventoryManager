actually put all this in server. Just have drones take commands.
also, move shit to center of storage room!

--get server ok to run?
while oktorun
  if energylow then
    os.sleep(5)
    print("chargin... "..energy)
  elseif there's something in the chest
    suck up as much of it as you can
    pass item name and quantity to server, get right locations (in case you need to fill 2)
    go to addresses and dump the stuff
    return to charger
  end
end
